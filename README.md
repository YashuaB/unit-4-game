In this assignment I created fun and interactive game for web browsers. This time, your app must dynamically update your HTML pages with the jQuery library.
 
 live site: https://yashuab.github.io/unit-4-game/

 The player will have to guess the answer, just like in Word Guess. This time, though, the player will guess with numbers instead of letters. 

 Here's how the app works:

 There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

When they do click one, update the player's score counter.

The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.


The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.

To run the application locally, first clone this repository with the following command.

git clone https://github.com/YashuaB/unit-4-game.git
